# MobileApps
We decided to use discord for communication, and in Trello having all the tasks we had to develop
As for the GitHub, we mentioned in the presentation we had many problems with commits from Android studio, so the UI design was developed by ALberto and Piotr.
The backend part of the app (java files) were worked mostly by ALberto and Jaime, but just uploaded them from Albertos computer, since Jaime and Alberto live toguether. We felt unnecessarry to do different commits since we worked the whole process toguether. As for trello, it was Alberto who managed it, but he only checked as done a task when the person involved in it told him to do so.
